          Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering at Syracuse University, I am confident that this program will provide me with the essential training, skills, and experience needed to thrive in my academic career. My specific interests include bioinformatics, machine learning, computer vision, image & video processing, medical device design, big data, and IoT.  I volunteered at Syracuse University in a research lab for approximately a year, where I studied to a project focused on developing a preprocessing approach using Deep Learning models for fNIRS data to predict cognitive workload.

	  In my first Master's degree at Izmir Institute of Technology, we developed a real-time blood vessel imaging system, recognizing the importance of early detection for circulatory system irregularities as indicators of potential health issues. It represents a significant advancement in vascular imaging, offering a non-invasive, cost-effective solution that has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. This study, which has its roots in engineering, emphasizes the crucial role that technology plays in advancing medical science and improving patient outcomes.

	  During my undergraduate studies Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Karadeniz Technical University, we designed a 'Smart Cane' for the visually impaired. The study, aimed to empower the visually impaired by providing them with enhanced mobility and safety. Through the integration of navigation systems and sensors, it offered real-time feedback to the user, enabling them to navigate their surroundings with greater confidence and ease.

	  I am enthusiastic about advancing my path in research and innovation, fueled by my unwavering commitment to creating a significant and positive impact.
